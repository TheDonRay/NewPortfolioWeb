          Ideas Made Real is more than a motto to me—it’s how I approach
          building. Growing up, I was always full of big, sometimes
          unconventional ideas, and that curiosity is what pushed me to keep
          creating. I don’t build just to add lines to a résumé. I build to
          create things that matter—things that can make a real impact on
          society. That’s me. — Rayat Chowdhury
